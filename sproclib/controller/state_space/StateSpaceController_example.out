Performance Characteristics
---------------------------
Advantages of State-Space Control:
- Systematic design procedures (LQR, pole placement)
- Optimal performance with explicit objectives
- Natural MIMO capability
- Guaranteed stability margins
- Internal state insight

Typical Applications:
- Multi-component distillation columns
- Reactor networks with recycle
- Heat exchanger networks
- Batch crystallization processes
- Multi-stage separation systems

Design Guidelines:
- Q matrix: Weight important states heavily
- R matrix: Balance control effort costs
- Observer: Design 3-5x faster than controller
- Validation: Check controllability/observability

Economic Impact:
- 10-20% improvement in product quality
- 5-15% reduction in energy consumption
- 20-40% reduction in process variability
- Decreased operator workload

Implementation Considerations:
- Requires accurate process model
- Higher computational requirements
- More complex commissioning
- Operator training requirements
- Suitable for well-instrumented processes
