Transport (Pipes, Drums)Package
=================

The transport package provides comprehensive modeling capabilities for fluid and material transport
systems in process control applications. This package contains models for continuous and batch
transport operations across different phases and flow regimes.

.. note::
   This is part of the modern modular structure of SPROCLIB. The transport package includes
   advanced physics-based models for process engineering applications.

Package Structure
-----------------

The transport package is organized by operational mode and phase:

* **Continuous Transport** - Steady-state and dynamic transport operations
  
  * **Liquid Transport** - PipeFlow, PeristalticFlow, SlurryPipeline
  * **Solid Transport** - PneumaticConveying, ConveyorBelt, GravityChute, ScrewFeeder

* **Batch Transport** - Discrete material handling and transfer operations
  
  * **Liquid Transport** - BatchTransferPumping
  * **Solid Transport** - DrumBinTransfer, VacuumTransfer

All transport models inherit from the ProcessModel base class and provide both steady-state and dynamic analysis capabilities.

Continuous Liquid Transport
---------------------------

The continuous liquid transport module provides three specialized models for different
transport applications. These models are fully documented with examples and validation data.
